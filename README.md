# pmlib
A python library for (finite) Partial Monitoring algorithms

## Partial monitoring

Partial Monitoring(PM) is a general framework for sequential decision making with imperfect feedback.
PM generalizes a host of problems including for instance multi-armed bandits, prediction with expert 
advices, dynamic pricing, apple tasting, dark pools, label efficient prediction and dueling bandits.

Each problem is formalized by a couple of NxM matrices L and F.
At each step of the game, the learner chooses an action i and the environment chooses an outome j.
L(i,j) gives the loss of action i for outome j and F(i,j) gives a (symbolic or numeric) feedback for this situation.

See N. Cesa-Bianchi, G. Lugosi "Prediction, Learning, and Games" 2006 on chapter 6 for an introduction:

## The library

We plan to add several generic PM algorithm, but the present version only includes FeedExp3 and its variants.
See http://archive.cone.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/pubs/siim-tr-00-18.pdf or 
http://stoltz.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Publications/CBLS-pmonit.pdf

We also provide Rex3, an adhoc algorithm for dueling bandits:

The Function `pmlib.problemClass(game)` can analyze any game and provide its position in the PM complexity hierarchy as defined in
(Bartok et al. "Partial monitoring â€“ classification, regret bounds, and algorithms" 2013).
This can be either:
* **TRIVIAL** if a single action domines all others. It gives a constant regret.
* **EASY** if it is hard but all neighbouring actions are locally observable. It gives a regret in \sqrt(T).
* **HARD** if all pairs of actions are globally observable. It gives a regret in T^{2/3}.
* **INTRACTABLE** if some pairs of actions are non globally observable.

## install guide
This library is based on the the Parma Polyhedra Library for the "Cell decomposition":
